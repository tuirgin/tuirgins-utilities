# License

The glyphs used in this project are based on the Adobe's SIL Licensed typeface, Source Code Pro. See LICENSE-SOURCE-CODE-PRO.md in this repository, and the font's own git repository: <https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro>

The cartography symbols are traditional within the old-school D&D community and are, to the best of my knowledge, in the public domain. The symbols were all newly drawn using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), however their updated forms are influenced by the work of Richard J. LeBlanc, Jr. as published in [*d30 DM Companion,*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/102567/d30-DM-Companion?), by New Big Dragon Games Unlimited.

Most color selections for the alpha-numeric glyphs based on Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).
